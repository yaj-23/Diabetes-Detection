## Diabetes-Detection

# Objective: 
Determining if a patient has diabetic conditions based on multiple data points - the following are proven to be connected to the cause of Diabetes Mellitus. The condition refers to the state in which the human body cannot generate sufficient insulin to help the body break glucose to supplement the body with energy. 
Gender, 
Age, 
Blood Urea Nitrogen Level, 
Creatinine, 
Hemoglobin, 
Cholesterol, 
Triglycerides, 
High-Density Lipoprotein, 
Low-Density Lipoprotein, 
Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein, 
Body Mass Index 

# How It Works:
Provide your data, where each array index refers to the abovementioned factors. :
 [0,49,4.7,36,2.6,4.2,0.9,2.4,4,0.5,23.0]
Next, run the python file. This is the current testing method - check backlog for future adaptations. 


# Back Log:
Implement an efficient way of testing data with predictions
Get more data - the current data set is small, resulting in higher accuracy results. 
Create UI to offer a better way to test individual data
Run evaluations and try out different models for better accuracy
